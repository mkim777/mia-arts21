			<div class="header">GRAY </br> LADY</div>
			<div class="subheader">BY S. BERT COOKSLEY</div>
			<div class="poem">She is a shadow there. She is a nun </br>
			Without the grave sophistry of a rood. </br>
			Day beds with day, week beds with week, and one </br>
			By one the years go. One by one. Her food </br>
			A dark and ancient stairway going up </br>
			To an ancient room and an ancient bed. </br>
			Daily she takes communion from the cup </br>
			Kissed by the first hands laying out their dead. </br>
			No more than shadow in a weathered house, </br>
			Part of a wall, a shelf, part of a floorâ€” </br>
			So silent there the smallest waiting mouse </br>
			Tires of listening at the cupboard door; </br>
			And kisses given her will come as rain </br>
			Given to soil no man shall reap again.
