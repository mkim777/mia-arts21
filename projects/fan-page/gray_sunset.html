			<div class="header">A GRAY </br> SUNSET</div>
			<div class="subheader">BY HAMLIN GARLAND</div>
			<div class="poem">She sits to watch the evening sun, </br>
			Her gnarled hands folded on her knees. </br>
			Upon her hair the river breeze </br>
			Lays light cool palm. Her work is done. </br>
			She rests as one who fears to rest. </br>
			With chin upthrust she seems to wait </br>
			A summons—some dread footstep at the gate— </br>
			Her breath scarce lifts her lean bent breast. </br> </br>

			Her wayward sons are all afar; </br>
			Her daughters drudge for tired men. </br>
			Her husband’s grave lies up the glen, </br>
			And she, the sport of some grim star, </br>
			Sits there alone with dim dull eyes. </br>
			Of what she dreams I cannot tell. </br>
			Her pains have fitted her for hell— </br>
			Her deeds should lift her to the skies. </br> </br>

			It seems God cursed her at the start; </br>
			She was foredoomed to toil and pain. </br>
			She has no higher prize to gain </br>
			Than rest, and endless quietude of heart. </br>
			Hunger, and solitude, the agony of birth, </br>
			The numbing dulness of the daily task </br>
			She has not shunned; she does not ask </br>
			Her God to free her from the earth.
