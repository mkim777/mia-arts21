			<div class="gunpowder-header">GUNPOWDER </br> MORNING IN A </br> GRAY ROOM</div>
			<div class="gunpowder-subheader">BY DOUGLAS CRASE</div>
			<div class="gunpowder-poem">Everything turns up in me in time </br>
			As a month will ride the refrigerator door </br>
			For months into winter, heading home. The furnace, </br>
			Which is nearly too close for comfort when it comes on, </br>
			Moves secrets truer than functions inside the room </br>
			By every one of which I’m to be warned and drawn, </br>
			And though this is impossible because none is there </br>
			Gradually they lay up their own temper anyhow </br>
			As if to prove, “Meantime, this is the way rest is: </br>
			On a siding an empty flatcar will fill with snow.” </br>
			For a person, it gets to be a matter of concern </br>
			Being the transport of too many arguments not your own </br>
			And under a season patiently endured (piling up, </br>
			Melting away, piling up and melting away) </br>
			It’s natural to envy the pitch of pure integrity, </br>
			How it would be living under that roof— </br>
			The weight of the climate slipped from the eaves </br>
			Along with the snow. Not to feel the weather, </br>
			How would that feel? To be tuned to a shape </br>
			Long since assumed, sure, single, in from the wind. </br>
			There are people like this, steep with intent </br>
			And valid as of that entry long ago. Each time </br>
			They are more engagingly unreal, these precious others </br>
			Who persist unrearranged, unregistering. Still, </br>
			To be in is to miss the way the day went </br>
			And this is so: the “as ifness” of the world is real, </br>
			Productive, wherever it comes from can’t be ignored </br>
			Though it may work against the solidest masonry, </br>
			The oldest of fieldstone farmhouse walls. The manner </br>
			Of meaning is its drift from whatever it means with, </br>
			The same as a snowdrift elaborates wind </br>
			Out of obstacles to the wind, being altered daily </br>
			To be annually kept true. Not to be of that climate </br>
			Though, how would that be? An accurate morning </br>
			Unintervened, a color alike indoors as out, </br>
			And the sound of somebody spinning their tires </br>
			Neither to come for me nor as if to go.
