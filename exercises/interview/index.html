	     	<div class="i1">INTERVIEWER</div>
	     	<div class="question1">Why did you participate in this experiment?</div>
	     	<div class="w1">WALSH</div>
	     	<div class="answer1">All my relationships keep failing. Am I fucking them up, or have I not met the right guy? Tim and I have been friends for years, and we always make fun of each other about our relationship problems. I wonder if putting two people together with opposite issues could help. Plus, these problems seem to be common with many other girls and guys we know, so I want to learn more about love and relationships in an attempt to figure out why</div>

	     	<div class="question2">Do you like dating?</div>
	     	<div class="w2">WALSH</div>
	     	<div class="answer2">I prefer being single or being in a relationship. Dating can be fun, but it can also just be painfully awkward.</div>

     			<div class="i3">Interviewer</div>
	     		<div class="question3">What is difficult about dating in NYC?</div>
	     	</div>
	     	<div class="sub-nested3">
	     		<div class="w3">Walsh</div>
	     		<div class="answer3">Everyone is too busy and thinks they can do better. I can be shy around new people, so I’ve had a hard time meeting guys here. For a long while the only interest I was getting was from a construction worker who would catcall near 15th street. Eventually I tried online dating, and I did meet some great guys, but it didn’t work out with any of them.</div>

     		<div class="i4">Interviewer:</div>
     		<div class="horizontal-line"></div>
	     	<div class="question4">When was your last serious relationship?</div>
	     	<div class="w4">Walsh:</div>
	     	<div class="horizontal-line"></div>
	     	<div class="answer4">It ended a year and a half ago. It was painful since we were very much in love. We had many wonderful years together, we lived together, and we had a dog together. However, after discovering he was lying to me for months, the relationship deteriorated.</div>

     	<div class="sub-container5">
	     	<div class="question5"><span class="i5">Interviewer:</span> What do you think about Tim’s current dating life?</div>
	     	<div class="line5"></div>
	     	<div class="answer5"><span class="w5">Walsh:</span> Tim disappears on girls soon after things start to get serious. I don’t think there is anything wrong with him dating around if he is honest about it, but I do think he is leading some of these girls on unintentionally. It would be nice if he developed a healthier perspective towards relationships, so if he does meet a great girl, he doesn’t fuck it up.</div>
